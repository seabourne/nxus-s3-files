## nxus-s3-files

### 

S3 File Uploads.

A Nxus module for uploading files to AWS S3.
It supports direct (client) or processed (server) file uploads.

See <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3> for details on configuring S3 buckets for public use.

**Installation**

    > npm install nxus-s3-files --save

**Module configuration**

Configuration is through the `s3-files` nxus configuration entry, which
may contain these options:

-   `awsKey`: AWS access key
-   `awsSecret`: AWS secret access key
-   `bucketName`: Default AWS Bucket name. Optional, can be overridden in use.
-   `directURL`: Route to define for signing a direct upload request. Optional, can be overriden in use.

**Direct client uploads**

In your module, request `app.get('s3-files').getUploadURL().then(({url, js}) => {..}`
to define a route for signing direct upload requests. Then use the
included js' `S3.getSignedRequest(url, file, filename, callback)`
to process a form's file input and send it to S3.

**Server side uploads**

In your module, reqest `app.get('s3-files').uploadFile(fileName, contents, {Bucket: bucketName})`
to send a file to the specified bucket on S3.

**A note on bucket names**

The file URL returned by the upload uses a "virtual-hostedâ€“style"
which includes the bucket name as part of the domain name. For this
to work correctly, you need to provide a DNS-compliant bucket name.
See <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html>
for a detailed description of what this means. In somewhat simplified
terms: 3-63 characters consisting of lowercase alphabetics (no
uppercase), numerics, and hypen (-) characters.
